This includes everything from sports shirts with heart rate monitors to car seats with built-in sensors. The global market for smart textiles is expected to grow by approximately 22 percent per year during this decade. At the same time, the market for wearable technology in Europe is growing by around 15.5 percent per year. It is estimated to reach a value of approximately $62 billion by 2031.'
